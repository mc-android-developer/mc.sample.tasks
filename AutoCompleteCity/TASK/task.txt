Implement an autocompleting travel search form

On the form, the user is required to enter the start and end location and the date of their trip. The start and end location need to be automatically completed using a list of known locations that can be requested through a JSON API invocation. When displaying matches, they should be ordered by distance to the user's current location. Date entry should be facilitated by a date entry widget. A "search" button should be available when the form has been completely filled out. Tapping the "search" button should display a "Search is not yet implemented" message to the user. The app should use one API endpoint:
GET http://api.goeuro.com/GoEuroAPI/rest/api/v2/position/suggest/en/STRING

Where STRING is the string that the user has entered so far.
API endpoint returns JSON documents like in file example.json

The endpoint always responds with a JSON object that has a results key. The value for that key is either null or an array of objects. Each object, among other keys, has a name and a geo_position key. The geo_position key is an object with latitude and longitude fields.


Your solution

Please implement your solution as an App that we can try out, i.e. send us an .apk file. We need Android 4.0+ compatibility. Also send us the source code to your solution. We use GitHub, so if you put your source code into a GitHub repository, it will make our life easy.
